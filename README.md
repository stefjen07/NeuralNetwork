# Basic Swift Neural Network Framework
Implementing this framework gives you basic information about how neural networks work.<br>
I have an article about this framework on Medium: https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-networks-on-swift-ba181dcdfde5<br>
Now I am working on a new version of the framework. This version will use Metal Performance Shaders and will be located here: https://github.com/stefjen07/ShadersNeuralNetwork<br>
## Framework includes:
- Dense, Convolutional 2D, Pooling, Flatten and Dropout layers;
- Sigmoid and ReLU activation functions;
- Multithreading support.
